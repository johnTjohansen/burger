# Eat-da-burger app
boot camp HW 14 - nodejs, express, handlebars, mysql, and modularization (MVC) exercise.

# Description  

This exercise is a full stack development using the MVC framework.  It uses a front-end of HTML/CSS and handlebars.  The back-end uses node-js, express, and handlebars.  Data is kept in a MYSQL database.  The main module is a command-line app 'server.js' and the front-end can be accessed by the browser at the "localhost" port.  

User will be prompted to enter the name of a burger (such as 'bacon onion ring burger') and press submit.  Burger will be added to the mysql database and displayed on the burger menu list.  When a burger is eaten (press the 'devoured' button) the burger will move to the "Eaten" list and the mysql database will be updated.  


Personal note:  I was not able to get this functioning in time.  I'm getting an error deep within a node-module that I cannot interpret or solve.
